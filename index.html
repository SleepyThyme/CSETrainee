        <p>Started my ice skating career during high school in year 10 with friends just casually skating around the rink.</p>
        <p>I also had 1 year of prior inline skating experience from primary school so transferring those skills definitely made it a lot easier!</p>
        <p>I then began skating with two of my other friends in year 12 (who went to skate school) and they taught me how to do a two-foot spin and a waltz jump but I was really terrible at it &#128517; so I kept practicing.</p>
        <p>Eventually I finally was able to do a half-decent waltz jump and a sketchy salchow shown below:</p>
